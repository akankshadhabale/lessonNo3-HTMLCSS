            <h1>My First Blog</h1>
          <p>I started coding on 29th of August 2021.On that day I watched and completed my first Project.Which is based on Repl.it.I also learned so many things during this journey. At very starting period it feel's like ...it;s too hard to code and became a good coder but as soon as I started doing assignment it turns out to be easier.Not easier actually, but yayy...what I was thought na It will be so hard but trust me it's not that much hard.Up till now I have learned following's thinks and so many yet to come.</p>
